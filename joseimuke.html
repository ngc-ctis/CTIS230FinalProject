    <h1 class="secondary">What is Joseimuke?</h1>
    <p>Nowadays, otome is under the umbrella of joseimuke [女性向け, lit. women-aimed], being the pioneer of the genre. <br> Joseimuke includes BL games, GL games, otome, mobage, and other games. It is an umbrella term for any and all media marketed and made for women.</p>
    <h3>Joseimuke Examples</h3>
    <h2 style= "text-align: left; font-size: 35px;">BL</h2>
    <img src="img/doramada.jpg" alt="" style="width:40%"></img>
    <p style= "text-align: left;">Arguably more popular than otome these days, BL, "boy's love" centers around romance between men. Fans of this genre are called fujoshis [腐女子, lit. rotten girl]. By far the most plentiful sub-genre of joseimuke. BL has tons of visual novels, as well as other media such as Drama CDs and manga. Some of the most famous (and infamous) BL games include <em>DRAMAtical Murder</em>, <em>Sweet Pool</em>, and <em>Lamento ~Beyond the Void~</em>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong style="color:red">Note: I highly, highly do NOT recommend looking any of these up. If you do, just know the entire genre is unfortunately like this. I don't have much choice.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2 style = "text-align: right; font-size: 35px;">GL</h2>
    <img src="img/flowers.jpg" alt="" style="width: 40%; display: block; margin-left: auto;"></img>
    <p style = "text-align: right;">By far the least popular out of these four 'sub-genres,' especially in games. GL, "girl's love," is a genre depicting romances between women. Fans of GL are called himejoshis [姫女子, lit. princess girl] and are the smallest demographic. They are usually overshadowed by the male fans of GL. There are no notable GL joseimuke games, since himejoshis usually go to male-directed franchises such as <em>IDOLM@STER</em> or <em>Love Live</em>. However, there is a growing manga scene of GL joseimuke works.</p>
    <h2 style = "text-align: left; font-size: 35px;">Mobage</h2>
    <img src= "img/enstars.png" alt="" style="width: 40%;"></img>
    <p style= "text-align: left;">Depending on who you ask, mobage can rival BL--though it goes hand-in-hand with it as well. Mobage, short for "mobile game," is all about games made for, well, mobile devices. Many of these joseimuke games have entirely male casts, and focus both on BL fanservice as well as yumejoshi/otome fanservice. Popular examples include <em>Ensemble Stars!!</em>, <em>Twisted Wonderland</em>, and <em>Touken Ranbu Online</em>.</p>
