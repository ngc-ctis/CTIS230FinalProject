    <h1 class="secondary">History of Otome Games</h1>
    <p>The game that pioneered the genre is considered to be <em>Angelique</em>. 
        Released in 1994(?) and developed by Ruby Party, it was created to be the "woman's <em>Nobunga's Ambition</em>." 
        Their goal was to broaden the appeal of Koei's simulation games, without being too difficult for those new to video games.
        They created a European fantasy setting and wrote the script with "sweet" and "feminine" as the defining characteristics.
        According to Keiko Erikawa, the production manager, she included the romance aspects to cater to an audience that was largely overlooked at the time of <em>Angelique's</em> development.
        The <em>Angelique</em> series has continued to today, with the latest entry in the series being <em>Angelique Luminaire</em> in 2021, which has sold 850,000 copies at the time of writing.

        The <em>Angelique</em> series isn't the only otome franchise considered to be a flag-ship of the genre. Konami's <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side</em>, Ruby Party's <em>La Corda d'Oro</em> [<em>金色のコルダ, kin'iro no koruda</em>], and Rejet's <em>Diabolik Lovers</em> are arguably the most popular and well-beloved otome franchises.

    <h3>So... what do you <em>do</em> in an Otome game?</h3>
    <p>Well, you date cute boys, of course! How about you (and your MC) go about that, though, can differ between otome games. In general, otome visual novels can be split into two categories in terms of gameplay: <em>stat-based</em> and <em>choice-based</em>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Stat-based</strong> games are all about raising your MC's stats in order to fit the requirements for the LI you want to get! The <em>Angelique</em> series is an example of this. Other examples include the <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side</em> franchise, <em>Dandelion ~Wishes Brought to You~</em>, <em>Hatoful Kareshi</em>, and <em>STORM LOVER.</em>
        The gameplay of these games usually consist of creating a weekly or daily schedule for your MC to increase your desired stats. They will be interrupted with visual novel moments and depending on the game, mini-games.
        In my opinion, it is even more vital to play these with a walkthrough than choice-based games.
        The downside to these games is that the gameplay loop can get tedious if you don't have enough breaks in it.
        My personal recommendation if you want to play this type of game would be to go with the <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side series,</em> and to avoid <em>Dandelion ~Wishes Brought to You~</em>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Choice-based</strong> games are basically the video game form of a 'choose-your-own-adventure' novel. The choices you make affect the story's direction, and your affection level with the LIs. This is by far the most common and most popular format of otome and visual novels nowadays--all of the notable otome <em>are</em> choice-based!
        The gameplay of these is more similar to an interactive novel than a game. Usually, the structure goes that you have a general route that acts as an prologue. It acts as an introduction to the setting, the characters, and the overall story.
        The choices you make here determines which of the LIs' routes you will end up on. When you're in the LIs' routes, the choices you make there determines which ending you will get.
        Usually, there is a bad ending, neutral ending, and good ending. How many of these there are depends on the individual game.
        Sometimes, certain LI's routes will be locked off until you finish the others, or you will be forced to go in a certain order. This is because with a lot of visual novels, a lot of the individual routes connect to make one cohesive story.
        If you play this type of game, I would recommend doing at least one blind playthrough on each of the routes. Afterwards, feel free to use a walkthrough!
