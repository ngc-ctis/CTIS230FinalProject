    <p> The <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side series</em> is a spin-off from the <em>Tokimeki Memorial</em> franchise, a galge dating sim with the same premise. 
        It debuted in 2002 with <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side</em> to massive success.
        It is a stat-based otome game, with each game featuring a 'prince' who is a childhood friend of the MC. The player can go shopping for clothes, befriend and become rivals with female side characters, go on dates, become best friends with their peers, <em>skinship</em> sections, and a Valentine's chocolate making minigame that is of the devil.
        In addition to the main LIs, each title has secret LIs you have to meet certain conditions in able to romance and get their ending. Each title improves on the last, with new features being added each game.

        The setting is in the city of Hatabaki, and depending on the game, the MC attends either Hatabaki High School or Hanegasaki High School. 
        There is no dramatic, overarching story--it simply depicts an average, yet idealized, life of a female Japanese highschooler. The games can be very nostalgic and relaxing to play through due to this universally shared experience.
        As of writing, there are four main installments in the series, with the most recent installment, <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 4th Heart,</em> releasing for the Nintendo Switch in 2021.
