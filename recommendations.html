    <p>There are so many Otome games, it can be hard to figure out where to start!
        Luckily, looking at the most popular otome games can give you good recommendations.
        I also have my personal recommendations below, which has a small overlap with the popular games.

    </div>
    <p> <em>AMNESIA: Memories</em> is considered a modern classic. It is one of the most iconic otomes, and is many people's first otome.
       You play as a woman who wakes up in-between worlds, without her memories, due to a collision with a fairy named Orion. He becomes trapped within her consciousness, and in order to leave, she must regain her memories. However, she must keep her amnesia a secret from those around her.
        <br><br>
        <em>BUSTAFELLOWS</em> is a newer otome, but no less exciting. You take on the role of Teuta Bridges, a journalist with the ability to go in the past using the bodies of others. 
        After witnessing the murder of an infamous laywer named Limbo, she goes back in time to try and save him.
        <br><br>
        <em>Hakuouki: Kyoto Winds</em> is another classic otome. 
        It is a historical fiction set in Japan's Bakumatsu period--a time inbetween the Shogunate era and the Meiji era.
        You play as Chizuru Yukimura, who goes to Kyoto to find her missing father, but ends up with the Shinsengumi, a group of warriors who defends the shogunate even as it crumbles.
        Somehow, Chizuru suspects they are hiding something amongst them.
        <br><br>
        <em>Cupid Parasite</em> is the most recent release out of all of these. You play as Lynette Mirror, the top bridal advisor in Los York, and secretly the goddess of love, Cupid.
        She's been sent to Earth to matchmaking the infamous Parasite 5--five men who are hopeless in love. They create the Parasite House, the setting for a reality TV centered around them and their adventures.
        Unfortunately, these men are proving to be difficult to matchmake even for the goddess of love! Can she keep her real identity a secret and help these men find love?
