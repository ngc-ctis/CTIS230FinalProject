    <p>The first <em>Diabolik</em> Lovers game, titled <em>Diabolik Lovers: Haunted Dark Bridal</em> released in 2012 for the PS-Vita at the height of the do-S and do-M craze in Japan... and can be considered very much a product of that craze.
        Do-S and do-M, meaning "super sadistic" and "super masochistic" spawned a lot of infamous otome, but none can compare to the sheer infamy and staying power of <em>Diabolik Lovers</em>.
        Developed by Rejet, a company more known for their drama CDs, the selling point of Diabolik Lovers was the use of binaural audio--and it's the shining point of the game, too.

        The MC, Yui Komori (yay, she has a name!) has to change schools after her father goes overseas for work. Unfortunately, Yui isn't able to accompany him, so he sends her to live with relatives. 
        When she gets to her "relative's" house, though, she's met with a seemingly abandoned mansion. Upon poking around, she runs into the six Sakamoto brothers, who are all vampires. 
        From then on, she goes through a lot at the hands of the Sakamoto brothers. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this series unless you like dark fiction, are playing it for a laugh, or just morbidly curious.
        The story is simple: while the art and music are gorgeous, they are pretty much just window dressing for the binaural audio.
