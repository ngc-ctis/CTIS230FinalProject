    <h1 class="secondary">Otome Media</h1>
    <p>Otome games have a <em>lot</em> of supporting media. If you pre-order an otome game, especially collector's editions or limited editions, you're bound to get <em>tokuten</em>, bonuses. What's included in them can change between stores, too. Some tokuten are exclusive to one store!
        One of the major things usually included in these are Drama CDs, which is detailed below. You also usually get bromide, exclusive character art printed on a card, and an art booklet.
        You get much more than those three things--but it varies between collector's editions!
    </p>
    <h3>Drama CDs</h3>
    <p>The closest thing we have to drama CDs in the West are audio-books. Compared to audio-books, drama CDs are much shorter and emphasize screenplay-like narration.
        Drama CDs have multiple tracks, totalling to about a runtime of 60-80 minutes. In the case of otome games, they are similar to Fandisks--they usually tell short, after-stories, with each track focusing on a different character.
        Outside of otome, drama CDs are a staple of joseimuke! There are entire companies dedicated to creating them, and it has a thriving doujin scene, both BL and otome-focused.
        In fact, one of the most popular otome game franchises, <em>Diabolik Lovers,</em> was a drama CD series before it was an otome game!
    </p>
    <h3>Anime Adaptions</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, otome games will have otome adaptions of their stories. 
        Due to the branching nature of otome games, almost all anime adaptions are regarded as poorer than the source material.
        However, some anime adaptions of otome games gain recognition outside of the games identity.
        This is infamously the case with <em>Diabolik Lovers'</em> anime, which has its own fanbase entirely separate from the game's fanbase.
        There are a handful of good otome anime adaptions, due to their decision of deciding to focus on one route instead of trying to cram all the love interests route into a 12 to 24 episode series.
        Examples of these include <em>Hakuoki</em> and <em>La Corda d'Oro's</em> anime adaptions.
    </p>
    <h3>Fandisks</h3>
    <p>Fandisks are games that take place after the main game. Sometimes they can be considered mini-sequels, but many are just one-off scenarios. 
        Fandisks usually depict an alternate universe, spin-offs, or just short, light-hearted scenarios of the characters featured in the main game.
        While they usually require knowledge of the main game to enjoy, they typically do not continue the main story in a major way.
        Popular fandisks examples include <em>Hakuoki SSL ~Sweet School Life~</em>, <em>AMNESIA LATER</em>, <em>Collar x Malice Unlimited</em>, and <em>Diabolik Lovers VANDEAD Carnival</em>.
